[PASSWORD CHALLENGE](https://tedtschopp.github.io/The-Password-Challange/Password%20Challange.html)
==================


Overview
--------

This code was modified from the code provided by Jeff Todnem (http://www.todnem.com/).
I have modified it to add a couple dictionaries.  Additionally I have added a measurement
to understand the size of the entropy.  Finally I have added a days to hack metric, that
is mostly handwaving and lies, but it was asked for by people.  

The code is messy and nothing I am overly proud of, but I have been lazy in getting into 
compliance with the GPL on this.

I might spend the time to get this into shape and into something that I am proud of.  Time
will tell.
